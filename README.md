# Comparing Stephen Curry: Rookie Years, MVP Seasons, and Later Career

## Dataset  
- **Name:** [Stephen Curry Stats 2009–2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mujinjo/stephen-curry-stats-20092021-in-nba/data)  
- **Source:** Kaggle dataset by user *mujinjo*  
- **Contents:** Game-by-game stats for Stephen Curry across seasons (2009 through ~2021/2023 depending on update), including shooting percentages, points, assists, rebounds, and more.  

## Motivation  
This project aims to examine how Stephen Curry’s performance has changed over his career by comparing three distinct phases:

1. **Rookie / Early Years** — roughly his first 2–3 seasons in the NBA  
2. **MVP Seasons** — seasons when he won the NBA Most Valuable Player award  
3. **Later Career** — more recent seasons following his MVP years  

The goal is to pinpoint:  
- What aspects of his game improved  
- What areas may have declined  
- How consistent or variable he has been over time
